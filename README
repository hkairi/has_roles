== Description

One of the easiest and most straightforward techniques for adding role management
and authorization to specific parts of your application is restricting usage on
controller/action-basis.  Each role defined in your system is mapped to one or
more permissions.  Each permission is a combination of a controller and action.

== Usage

Note that this is a reference implementation and, most likely, should be
modified for your own usage.

=== Adding permissions

To add permissions, you can either define your own Permission model or create
an initializer like so:

config/initializers/role_management:
  Permission.create :id => 2, :controller => 'admin/stats'
  Permission.create :id => 3, :controller => 'comments', :action => 'create'
  ...

=== Adding/Updating roles

To add or update roles, you can either define your own Role model or create an
initializer like so:

config/initializers/role_management:
  # Edit the default role called "administrator"
  Role[:administrator].permissions << Permission['admin/stats']
  
  # Create a new role called "developer"
  Role.create :id => 2, :name => 'developer', :permissions => [
    Permission['comments', 'create'],
    Permission['admin/stats'], 
    ...
  ]

=== Default Permissions/Roles

By default, the following permissions are define:
* application - Permission for accessing any part of the application

By default, the following roles are defined:
* admin - An administrator with the default permissions

You can get rid of the default permissions/roles by adding the following to your
role_management initializer:

config/initializers/role_management:
  Role.destroy_all
  Permission.destroy_all
  ...

=== Checking a user's authorization

Below is an example of checking a user's authorization for a url before displaying
information:

app/views/layouts/application.rhtml:

  <% if authorized_for?(:controller => 'admin/users') %>
  <p>Read to start administering your website?</p>
  <% end %>

== Testing

Before you can run any tests, the following gem must be installed:
* plugin_test_helper[http://wiki.pluginaweek.org/Plugin_test_helper]

== Dependencies
